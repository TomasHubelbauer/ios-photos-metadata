# iOS SVG

I experiment to see if an SVG saved directly from a site (using long tap) or by
an `a[download]` link is downloadable to iOS Photos and vieweable in there. Also
I want to find out if when uploaded back the SVG is in any way altered by iOS.

I do this because I want to explore SVG image export as a backup mechanism for
a mobile web app.
